# Introduction ðŸ‘‹ 
Hi, Iâ€™m @mlnederlof, an enterprise architect at the Netherlands Institute for Public Safety (www.nipv.nl). In my professional life, I'm interested in 'digitization' of society, especially with respect to governments. Therefore I work on several (reference) architectures, together with my collegues.
On a personal level, I'm interested in sports (trailrunning, gravelbiking and shaolin kempo), reading and topics as 'privacy', 'fediverse', 'open source'

# Currently working on ðŸŒ±
I'm currently working on the development of the architecture capability at NIPV.
I just change my Github-name from @gitgldarch to @mlnederlof
