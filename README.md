# Introduction ðŸ‘‹ 
Hi, Iâ€™m @mlnederlof, an enterprise architect at the Netherlands Institute for Public Safety (www.nipv.nl). In my professional life, I'm interested in 'digitization' of society, especially with respect to governments. Therefore I work on several (reference) architectures, together with my collegues. I read a lot of books about (enterprise) architecture, strategy, digital transformation, information management and so on.
On a personal level, I'm interested in sports (trailrunning, gravelbiking and shaolin kempo), reading and topics like 'privacy', 'fediverse', 'open source', 'mindfulness', 'zen' and 'martial arts'.<BR>

I've just changed my Github-name from @gitgldarch to @mlnederlof.

# Currently working on ðŸŒ±
